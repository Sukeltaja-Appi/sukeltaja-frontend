# Basic overview

## DOM Root structure:
![Alt text](frontendRootStructure.jpg "DOM root structure")

## Navigation

Rest of the React components are in the navigation tree,
or generally used by components in it. ([React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.com))
- Navigator components are screens in the app
- Navigator components always receive the prop `navigation`

### Moving from one component to another

`props.navigation.navigate('Component_Name_In_The_Navigation_Tree')`

### Give props with navigation

`props.navigation.navigate('Component_Name_In_The_Navigation_Tree', { parameterName: {})`

### Get navigation parameters

`props.navigation.getParam('parameterName')`

Navigating directly to a component anywhere in the whole tree is usually possible
unless this is explicitly prohibited.

### Other

The structure of the navigator is defined in:
- root:	[src/Navigator.js](https://github.com/Sukeltaja-Appi/sukeltaja-frontend/blob/master/src/Navigator.js)
- various component folders: index.js [(example)](https://github.com/Sukeltaja-Appi/sukeltaja-frontend/blob/master/src/components/EventScreens/index.js)

## Used Libraries

#### redux-thunk
- Allows asynchronous logic with the store.

#### react-native-offline
- Monitors internet availability.
- Can be used to queue sending requests until internet becomes available.

Implemented queuing requests on some reducer functions.

Used to notify the user if the internet is not available. ([OfflineNotifier.js](https://github.com/Sukeltaja-Appi/sukeltaja-frontend/blob/master/src/OfflineNotifier.js))

(Internet availability check is done on a general ping server, not on the app backend)

#### axios-retry
- Allows retrying unanswered requests for a given amount of time

Mostly used to wake up Heroku, but may increase general reliability of communication, if
the backend answers slowly for some reason.

May also unnecessarily stress the backend though, if it is moved from heroku.

#### socket.io
- Implements websocket connections
- Reconnects automatically if connection drops! (Necessary with heroku backend)

When the user logs in, a websocket connection is formed with the backend ([ServerListener.js](https://github.com/Sukeltaja-Appi/sukeltaja-frontend/blob/master/src/ServerListener.js)). The server sends updates through the websocket connection.

Currently it sends:
- new messages (invites) that have been sent to the user
- event updates - when someone updates an event the user participates in.

#### Other libraries you may need to get acquainted to:
- react-native
- react-native-elements
- react-native-maps-super-cluster
- luxon
